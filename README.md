##**Problem Statement**

  Miami Beach is a sink risk coastal community. Local officials work on strategies to reduce the risk of flooding due to increased sea levels [3]. The government hope to bring awareness of the dangers of flooding due to low terrain, extreme rainfall, annual real tides, and storms. The city investment in public infrastructure to mitigate the risk including rainfall, storms and sea levels rise with the best of science to do so [3].
  
The City of Miami beach is the economic lung for Miami Dade county. The tourism and the high cost for real states and the keep rise without thinking about the sinking problem ahead.  The effect will affect 13.1 million people and Miami-Dade and Broward Counties alone account for more than a quarter of this number of populations [4]. In 2015 the sea level rise is projected to be 6 to 10 inches by 2030 and 14 to 26 inches by 2060. The solution for this challenge is to evaluate the flow of the storm water drainage stations it can pump out the water bringing down flood waters from the city.
